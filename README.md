R | Unsupervised Learning Project



In this repository there is an Unsupervised Statistical Learning project with descriptions in both English and Turkish. 

The dataset is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about tumor cells. The task in this project was to extract the variable containing the information labeled as benign or malignant from the dataset and cluster the tumors as benign or malignant using clustering algorithms.
